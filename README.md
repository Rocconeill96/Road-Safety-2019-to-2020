# Excel-Projects-
This is a Summary folder for all my data related projects that were produced using purely excel as the main data manipulation tool

## Road-Safety-2019-2020:
### Brief: 
Asked to observe the road safety datasets from the UK government website and find and present some insights. I decided to focus on casualties in 2019 pre-pandemic and 2020 where the pandemic was at its peak. 

### Areas of focus: 
#### 1)Quantity of casualties across Urban, Small Towns and Rural Areas
#### 2)Casualty Severity within the area type
#### 3)Speed Limits 

### Data Cleaning: 
The answers to my questions didn't require much cleaning but when it was necessary i used to the following techniques:
-XLOOKUP(): 
-VLOOKUP()
-Pivot Tables
